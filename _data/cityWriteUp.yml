Imagine your favorite place to be on a sunny afternoon- likely, you are imagining a place outdoors surrounded by greenery and plants, whether it’s out in the wilderness, or simply in your back garden. Being surrounded by nature not only provides a greater sense of well-being, it’s also important for the biodiversity of our planet. However, as our population grows, so do our urban environments. 
Urban environments can stress many plants and animals. For example, cities are often hotter and have poorer soil, making it difficult for plants to grow. As plants contribute to the lives of many insects, birds, and mammals, a lack of plant diversity will also cause a decline in overall biodiversity.
However, there are some plant species that are able to survive in these stressful urban environments. One of these species is the Shepherd’s purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris). Shepherd’s purse is native to Europe and Asia, but it has colonised other areas including North America. The common name of this plant comes from its purse-like heart-shaped flat fruits.

You may have seen us collecting seeds from the Shepherd’s purse. We what makes this plant able to survive in urban landscapes. 

Now for the technical bit
For organisms to survive in different environments they need to adjust their phenotype (what temperatures they can survive in, what time of year they reproduce, etc). This phenotypic change can either be due to evolution, which depends on genetic change through time, or something called ‘phenotypic plasticity’, which is where a genotype (e.g. an individual) expresses different phenotypes in response to different environments. 
Currently our environments are changing at a faster rate than previously recorded, and some scientists suggest that evolution will not be able to happen fast enough to ensure survival. Instead, they suggest phenotypic plasticity is more important for facilitating survival during rapid environmental changes.  We aim to determine the contribution of evolution and plasticity for survival using urban populations of the Shepherd’s purse. Understanding how plants can survive in the urban landscape can provide an insight into how plants and other organisms might be able to survive in our fast-changing world.
